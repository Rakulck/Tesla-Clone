# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

I did this project to get familiar with react js and tailwind css.This is completely done for my leanring purpose.

This app is completely responsive.This is just a front end website where I focused only on designing it and using animations.
